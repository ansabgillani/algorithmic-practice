# Name: 
Search a 2D Matrix

## Difficulty: 
Medium

## Description: 
You are given an \(m \times n\) integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in `matrix` or `false` otherwise. You must write a solution with \(O(\log(m \times n))\) time complexity.
