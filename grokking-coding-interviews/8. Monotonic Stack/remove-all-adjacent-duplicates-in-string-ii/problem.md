# Name: 
Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II

## Difficulty: 
Medium

## Description: 
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. A `k` duplicate removal consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` duplicate removals on `s` until we can no longer do so. Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
