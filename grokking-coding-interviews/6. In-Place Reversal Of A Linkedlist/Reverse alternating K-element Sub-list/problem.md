Reverse alternate K nodes in a Singly Linked List
Last Updated : 04 Sep, 2024
Given a linked list, The task is to reverse alternate k nodes. If the number of nodes left at the end of the list is fewer than k, reverse these remaining nodes or leave them in their original order, depending on the alternation pattern.

Example: 

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL, k = 2
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 5 -> NULL. 
Explanation :The nodes are reversed alternatively after 2 nodes.


Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL, k = 3
Output: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8 -> 7-> NULL.
Explanation :The nodes are reversed alternatively after 3 nodes.
