Easy

## Description: 
You are given two 2D integer arrays, `items1` and `items2`, representing two sets of items. Each array `items` has the following properties:

- `items[i] = [value_i, weight_i]` where `value_i` represents the value and `weight_i` represents the weight of the i-th item.
- The value of each item in `items` is unique.

Return a 2D integer array `ret` where `ret[i] = [value_i, weight_i]`, with `weight_i` being the sum of weights of all items with value `value_i`. 

Note: `ret` should be returned in ascending order by value.
