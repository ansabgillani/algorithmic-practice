Level Order Successor of a node in Binary Tree

Given a binary tree and a node in the binary tree, find Levelorder successor of the given node. That is, the node that appears after the given node in the level order traversal of the tree.

Note: The task is not just to print the data of the node, you have to return the complete node from the tree.

Examples: 

Consider the following binary tree
              20            
           /      \         
          10       26       
         /  \     /   \     
       4     18  24    27   
            /  \
           14   19
          /  \
         13  15

Levelorder traversal of given tree is:
20, 10, 26, 4, 18, 24, 27, 14, 19, 13, 15

Input : 24
Output : 27

Input : 4
Output : 18
