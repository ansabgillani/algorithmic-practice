# Interval List Intersections

## Difficulty: 
Medium

## Description: 
You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [start_i, end_i]` and `secondList[j] = [start_j, end_j]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A **closed interval** `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The **intersection** of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

### Example 1:

![Input](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/interval1.png)

**Input:**
- `firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]]`
- `secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]`

**Output:**
- `[[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]`

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- `firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]]`
- `secondList = []`

**Output:**
- `[]`

### Constraints:
- `0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000`
- `firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1`
- `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^9`
- `end_i < start_(i+1)`
- `0 <= start_j < end_j <= 10^9`
- `end_j < start_(j+1)`
